# Basics of Penetration Testing
<!--- This is the documentation for the 4 machines related to Penetration Testing on HacktheBox.
The basic motive behind this is conveying what I have learned in a language that evan a non-tech background person can understand.
I have focused on my 'Tackling Methodology' and ' Key Takeaways' for this machins.
This is my first documentation and suggestions are welcome :D. --->

## Meow:

- First machine on HTB (very Easy), Learnt about how to connect to openvpn and the basic process of spawning a machine.

### Tackling Methodology:
1. Used `ping` to check if the machine is successfully operating or not.
2. After verifying, used `nmap` for scanning the top available ports. It thereby shows PORT, SERVICE, STATE, etc., useful info for that port.
3. Since telnet service was open, logged in it using `root` as credentials.
4. Noticed that the box was, in fact, Linux and was running Ubuntu.
5. Then at last, captured the flag by listing the files (There were only two: flag.txt and snap) 


## Fawn:

- Again, a very easy machine which solely focuses on 'File Transfer Protocol'. 
- This helped to enhance the knowledge at a practical level for FTP.

### Tackling Methodology:
1. Spawned the machine, pinged to check if established successfully or not. Again, used `nmap` for scanning the ports.
2. Scan results showed all info for PORT, STATE, SERVICE, VERSION.
3. Learnt about FTP Anonymity and using the same was able to transfer files (Binary Mode).
4. Used `get` command to download flag.txt and pwned the machine.

#### Key Takeaways:
- FTP uses TCP port.
- Being anonymous you may get a lot of benefit as you will be granted access if anonymous logins are supported (without knowing credentials).
- There are various response codes designated to particular things. E.g., 230 Login Successful, 331 Please specify the password, etc.


## Dancing:

- This machine helps us to familiarize ourselves with the Server Message Block (SMB) services.
- Popularly known as Samba is open-source software that runs SMB.

### Tackling Methodology:
1. Spawned the machine, used `ping`, used `nmap` for scanning ports.
2. I observed that there were multiple ports (3) displayed this time after scanning, all of which were open.
3. The port 445/tcp was up and running, which means we could potentially exploit the same. I did exactly the same.
4. Used `smbclient -L` to list the available shares on that port.
5. There were 4 shares, of which "WorkShares" one I was able to exploit with a blank password. 
6. After listing the files in this share, there were again two directories, one of which had flag.txt file. 
7. Used `get` to download the flag and pwned the machine.

#### Key Takeaways:
- An SMB-enabled storage on the network is called a share.
- Custom shares can be accessed with a blank password.
- Any database can be chosen just by using the select command followed by the index number as mentioned in Keyspace.

## Redeemed:

- This machine focuses on REDIS server in details.

### Tackling Methodology:
1. Spawned the machine, used `ping`, used `nmap` for scanning ports.
2. After scanning, observed that port 6379 was open and was using 'redis' service.
3. Searched about redis, used the command `redis-cli` to interact with redis server.
4. Gained info about the server using `info`, selected the required database using `select`.
5. Listed all the keys present in database using `keys*`.
6. Noticed that flag file was present in db, retrieved it using `get`. Thus, pwned the machine.

#### Key Takeaways:
- REDIS is open-source NoSQL database in which data is stores in form of key-value pairs.
- The Keyspace section provides statistics on main dictionary of each database.
- `keys*` can be used for listing all the keys prior to selecting database.
